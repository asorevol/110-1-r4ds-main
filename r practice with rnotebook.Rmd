This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

## Basic Data Type

```{r}
"Mary" #double quotation
'Friday' #single quotation
'Today is Wednesday' #ONE character value
```

### Numeric

```{r}
2 #double 2.000000000
3.1415928 

2L #save as 2 (save resorse) (but it rarely use)






```

#### Logical

```{r}
TRUE=T #capital
FALSE=F #capital

#but don't put it in "" or ''
```

##### Collection of Values

```{r}
"John"
'Mary'



```

\#use c( ) if they r the same type

```{r}
c( " John " , ' Mary ') #atomic
c( 1 , 4.14 , 300 ) #atomic
c( T , F ) #atomic
```

\#if u want to put different type of character together use list()

```{r}

typoof(list("John" , T , 165 ))

```

[[number]] will out put the element which is that number.

```{r}

c("John", "Mary")[[1]]


```

```{r}


c("John", list("mary" , 35), "Mary")[[2]]


```

this is wrong since that the element have no 4th element

```{r}


list("John",42, list("Mary", 35))[[4]]


```

\#\#2.9

binding

```{r}

personName <- c("Mary" , "Ken")
personName = c("Mary" , "Ken")
c("Mary" , "Ken") -> personName
#these r all the same 
 
```

```{r}

bigList <- list("John",42, list("Mary", 35))

```

```{r}

bigList[[3]][[2]]

```

which is

```{r}

list("John",42, list("Mary", 35))[[3]][[2]]


```

what R did is that

```{r}

list("John",42, list("Mary", 35))[[3]]
#which will show list("Mary", 35)

```

than

```{r}

list("Mary" , 35)[[2]]
#which will show 35

```

quiz

```{r}

list("John", 42, 
  list("Mary", 35,
    c(1, 22, 53))
  )[[3]][[3]][[2]]



```

\#\#2-10

```{r}

c(c('a' , 'b' ) , 'c')
#which will break the c() inside the 
#c()

```

as the result

```{r}

c(c('a','b'), c('c','d'))


```

if u want to extract "d"

u can't just do

```{r}

c(c('a','b'), c('c','d'))[[2]][[2]]

```

what u need to type is

```{r}

c(c('a','b'), c('c','d'))[[4]]


```

but list will not break the c()

quiz

```{r}


list(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d"))[[2]][[2]]

```

so

```{r}

c(list("a", 1), list("c", 2))[[4]]

```

will go into

```{r}

c('a' , "1" , 'c' , "2")[[4]]

```

but this is a problem that

the number 1and 2 will become a chracter but a number which can not do any math!!!\
(since c() can only type the same stuff

prob if c( list( 1 , 2 ) , list( 3 , 4 ) )

```{r}

c( list( 1 , 2 ) , list( 3 , 4 ) )

```

2-12

Four feature

age , gender , income , resident

```{r}

A <- list(54,"male","north",100)
B <- list(32,"female","south",25)
C <- list(28,"female","east", NA)
#if there is a data without than we use NA to show.
D <- list(20,"male","east",77)
```

```{r}

data_set <- list(A,B,C,D)

```

and we don't use

```{r}

c(
  list(54, "male", "north", 100),
  list(  32, "female", "south", 25),
  list(  28, "female", "east", NA),
  list(  20, "male", "east", 77))
)

```

will be the same as

```{r}

list(54, "male", "north", 100, 
  32, "female", "south", 25,
  28, "female", "east", NA, 
  20, "male", "east", 77)

```

Name elements values

```{r}

c("John" = 177 , "Mary" = 160 , "Bill" = 170 )[["John"]]
#atomic vector


```

\# If u want to give element value always use "=" !!

!!

```{r}

list(
  list( age=54, gender="male", region="north", income=100),
  list(  age=32, gender="female", region="south", income=25),
  list(  age=28, gender="female", region="east", income=NA),
  list(  age=20, gender="male", region="east", income=77)
)-> simpledata #binding

simpledata[[2]][["income"]]
# if u want to extract the vaule out u need to type 
# "the name of it"


```

the mean of it is like

```{r}

simpledata[[2]][["income"]]#second part and the value "income" in the binding simpledata

```

the thing that list() can do "\$"

```{r}

list(
  "personA"=list( age=54, gender="male", region="north", income=100),
  "personB"=list(  age=32, gender="female", region="south", income=25),
  "personC"=list(  age=28, gender="female", region="east", income=NA),
  "personD"=list(  age=20, gender="male", region="east", income=77)
)-> simpledata #binding

simpledata$personB[["gender"]]


```

and the "\$" have one advantage is that u will have a list if u type ur binding.

Calculus , Mon 5\~7 , Business1F09

Politics , Fri 5\~6 , Law2F28

```{r}
list(
  list(
    time= "Mon 5~7",
    place="business1F09"
      ) -> Calculus ,
  list(
    time="Fri 5~6",
    place="law2F28"
      ) -> Politics
) 

simple$Calculus[["time"]]



```

```{r}

list(
  "Calculus"=list(
  time= "Mon 5~7",
  place="business1F09"
),

  "Politics"=list(
  time="Fri 5~6",
  place="law2F28"
)
)

```

## list with a title

```{r}

list(
  Compulsory = 
    list("Principle of Economics", 
      "Calculus", 
      "Accounting"), #u can use c() though ur stuff need to b same element
  Selective = 
    list("Philosophy", 
      "Chinese Literature")
)

```

## import Json
F1

```{r}

# Observation by observation
concerts_obo <-
  jsonlite::fromJSON("https://cloud.culture.tw/frontsite/trans/SearchShowAction.do?method=doFindTypeJ&category=17", simplifyDataFrame = F)

# Feature by feature
concerts_fbf <-
  jsonlite::fromJSON("https://cloud.culture.tw/frontsite/trans/SearchShowAction.do?method=doFindTypeJ&category=17", simplifyDataFrame = T)

```
what this "TRUE and FAUSE" about is that u bind these two stuff. than u can just call them use it later.

obo is more easier to understand but fbf is easier to write though it's massive size.

3-2

c out 
which can use [["name"]] or [[number]]
or [[c(1,2,5)]] [["name1","name2"]]
```{r}

JohnsFamily <-
  list(
    name = "John", 
    age = 35,
    spouse = list(
      name = "Mary", 
      age = 32),
    children = list(
      list(
        name = "Bill", 
        age = 5),
      list(
        name = "Jane", 
        age = 3)
    )
  )
JohnsFamily[["children"]][[1]][["age"]]
#if u want to know Bill's age

```
if u want to know the imformation of the length

```{r}

  
  length(JohnsFamily) 
  length(list(
    name = "John", 
    age = 35,
    spouse = list(
      name = "Mary", 
      age = 32),
    children = list(
      list(
        name = "Bill", 
        age = 5),
      list(
        name = "Jane", 
        age = 3)
    ))
  )

```
check the element nome 
```{r}

names(JohnsFamily)

```

```{r}

fncallExample <- list("John", 35, covid19Positive=FALSE)
length(fncallExample)
names(fncallExample)

```
```{r}

Sys.Date() #show the date today

```

```{r}
Sys.time()
```

```{r}
car() #
```

if i want to know JohmsFamily's name and age
```{r}

JohnsFamily[c(1,2)] #if u use list() at start u will get a list() when u do this
JohnsFamily[c( "name" , "age" )]

```

EX
```{r}

concerts_sampled <- concerts_obo[c(3,5)] 
firstShowInfo <- concerts_obo[[2]][["showInfo"]][[1]][c("time","location")]

```


















Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
